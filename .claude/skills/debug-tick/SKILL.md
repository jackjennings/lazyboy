# Debugging the lazyboy tick

## Overview

The tick's own evidence lives in `~/.lazyboy/tick.ndjson`, one JSON object per
line with `ts` (ISO 8601 UTC) and `event`. It is written by `appendTickLog`
(`src/tick.ts`) — distinct from `appendTicketLog`, which writes the per-ticket
log. The runtime dir is resolved by `lazyboyDir()` (`src/paths.ts`):
`$LAZYBOY_DIR` when set, otherwise `$HOME/.lazyboy`.

The LaunchAgent runs the tick every 5 minutes. The plist must never point
`StandardOutPath` or `StandardErrorPath` at `tick.ndjson` — the tick owns its
own writes; a plist that does this means someone broke that invariant.

For problems with a specific ticket — wrong output, unexpected park, missing PR
— use `triage-ticket` instead.

## Procedure

1. **Run `lazyboy doctor` first.** It automates the most common checks:
   LaunchAgent loaded and healthy, tick freshness and stale-lock detection,
   required env vars set and non-empty, and launchd non-demand spawn
   suppression. If doctor surfaces a clear fail with a remedy, follow the remedy
   before continuing. The manual steps below are for when doctor output is
   ambiguous or you need to drill deeper into the raw evidence.
2. **Is the LaunchAgent loaded?** Check with
   `launchctl print gui/<uid>/com.jackjennings.lazyboy` (`detectLaunchdEnabled`
   in `src/launchd.ts`). Use `lazyboy enable` / `lazyboy disable` to manage it.
   These operate the LaunchAgent only and are unrelated to `config.toml`, which
   is re-read on every tick with nothing to restart.
3. **What do the last lines of `tick.ndjson` say?** Tail the file; each line has
   `ts` (ISO 8601 UTC) and `event`.
4. **Is there a live or stale `tick.pid`?** The pid file is
   `~/.lazyboy/tick.pid`. Lock behavior: if the pid file exists and the recorded
   pid is alive, and the file's mtime is under 30 minutes
   (`STALE_LOCK_MS = 30 * 60 * 1000` at `src/lock.ts:20`), the tick logs
   `tick-already-running` and returns silently. Past 30 minutes it logs
   `stale-lock` (with `thresholdMinutes`) and takes the lock anyway. Any throw
   during acquisition logs `lock-failed`. The pid file is removed in a
   `finally`, so a leftover `tick.pid` means the process died hard. A run of
   consecutive `tick-already-running` lines is the normal symptom of one wedged
   tick blocking all subsequent ones for up to 30 minutes.
5. **Did the tick reach `tick-end` or log `tick-failed`?** Both events are in
   `tick.ndjson`.
6. **Do credentials resolve in a non-GUI context?** See the Credentials section
   below.
7. **Is the symptom actually per-ticket?** For problems with a specific ticket —
   wrong output, unexpected park, missing PR — use `triage-ticket` instead.

## Events reference

| `event`                | Meaning                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tick-start`           | Tick loop began                                                |
| `tick-end`             | Tick loop completed normally                                   |
| `tick-failed`          | Tick loop threw an unhandled error                             |
| `tick-already-running` | Pid file exists, pid alive, age < 30 min; tick exited silently |
| `stale-lock`           | Pid file exists but age ≥ 30 min; lock taken anyway            |
| `lock-failed`          | Lock acquisition threw; tick exited                            |

## Credentials under launchd and cron

In a non-GUI session the login keychain is locked, so `gh auth token` returns
empty. The tick then sends `Authorization: Bearer` (empty) and GitHub answers
401. Rotating a token cannot fix this.

Credentials must come from `~/.config/lazyboy/env`, which `scripts/tick.sh`
sources (lines 12–17) and `bin/lazyboy` also sources. `config.toml` startup
validation checks only that each `[github.accounts.*].token_env` is _set_, not
that its value is non-empty, so an empty-but-set variable passes validation and
fails per-request. (`lazyboy doctor` check 9 tests both conditions — set and
non-empty.)

To diagnose: reproduce the non-GUI environment rather than trusting an
interactive shell, and confirm the token variable resolves to the expected value
before blaming the pipeline.

## Recurring macOS permission prompts

The prompts are `kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAppData` ("wants to access data from
other applications"). The responsible binary is Deno, but the actual requesters
are child processes (`op`, `claude`, `find`, `zsh`). TCC keys grants by the
responsible binary's absolute path; these live at version-numbered Homebrew
paths (`/opt/homebrew/Cellar/deno/<version>/bin/deno`), so every `brew upgrade`
invalidates the grant and re-prompts.

Fix directions: grant Full Disk Access to `/opt/homebrew/bin/deno` (re-grant
after upgrades), or grant `op` access once. Deno's `--allow-read` flag and macOS
TCC are orthogonal enforcement layers; scoping `--allow-read` cannot affect what
a spawned subprocess reads.

## Gotchas

- **Log timestamps are UTC; `ls`/`stat` mtimes are local.** Convert before
  claiming one event preceded another.
- **Hard constraint: `--allow-sys=kill` is not a valid `--allow-sys` kind.** It
  causes Deno to fail at startup, breaking every command including the tick.
- **Hard constraint: `Deno.kill` requires unscoped `--allow-run`.** `Deno.kill`
  is used by `isProcessAlive` (`src/executor.ts`), which `PidFileLock` and
  `src/commands/decline.ts` depend on. Scoped `--allow-run=git,deno,…` makes it
  throw `NotCapable`; `isProcessAlive` swallows the throw, and then every live
  phase agent looks dead. Any future permission-scoping work must leave
  `--allow-run` unscoped.
